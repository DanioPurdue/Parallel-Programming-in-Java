Difference between `RecursiveAction` and `RecursiveTask`

## Streams

Both the existing Java notion of collections and the new notion of streams provide interfaces to a sequence of elements. So whatâ€™s the difference? In a nutshell, collections are about data and streams are about computations.

method reference: how to use it

when should we use method reference:

*Instead of using*  **AN ANONYMOUS CLASS**
*you can use* **A LAMBDA EXPRESSION**
*And if this just calls one method, you can use* **A METHOD REFERENCE**

## Determinism

### Functional Determinism

same input -> same output

### Structrual Determinism

same input -> same comp graph

```
SUM = SUM1 + SUM2
```

Data Race Freedom: functional determinims and structural determinism

"Benign NonDet" : both the values are acceptable, even though you may have different answers everytime.

## Stream

you should move the recursion into the `compute()` function.
